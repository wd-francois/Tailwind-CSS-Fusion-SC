        <p>Fusion Strength and Conditioning is a fully equipped personal training studio and gym in Melbourne’s North. 
            As a home fitness studio and gym, clients can train in a comfortable space, without the distractions of a commercial gym.
            All training programs are individually tailored, with a focus on achieving goals in a safe and supportive environment.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Francois Swart is the trainer behind Fusion Strength and Conditioning. Francois is a nationally certified personal trainer
            through Fitness Australia, with additional qualifications in Exercise Rehabilitation, Strength Training and Nutrition.</p>
            <br>
            <p>With more than 15 years of experience, he has worked with a wide range of clients with varying goals and abilities – from athletes
            who want to improve at their sport, to everyday people who want to lose some weight, build strength or improve their overall health and wellbeing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While much of his career has been spent in commercial gyms, the challenges of 2020 also presented new opportunity. <br> Francois has now started his own
            personal training studio and gym at his home in Melbourne’s North.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            Francois is passionate about helping people achieve their goals, and is focused on the individual needs of each client.
            He believes that everyone is different, so each training program should reflect this. There is no ‘one size fits all’ model.
            His training programs are built on simple, safe and proven principles, but his methods are always changing and evolving so his clients can progressively,
            and safely, build toward their ultimate goal. He is committed to supporting his clients outside of their training sessions too, from providing at home programs
            to advice on healthy eating and nutrition.</p>
